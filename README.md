- 👋 Hi, I’m @henri123lemoine
- 👀 I’m interested in AI (especially DNNs), robotics, statistics, mathematics, CS, evolutionary biology, psychology (rationality, heuristics and biases, neuroscience), and literature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), Data Science (Pandas and mathplotlib), 3D simulations with Python (blender, open3d, vpython), and Arduino/Raspberry-Pi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I'd learn from!
